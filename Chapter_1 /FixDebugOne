/*

Bugs:
1.The class name is wrong. It has a space FixDebug One. It should be FixDebugOne.


2.The main method is wrong. It is written as Main(String args). The correct one is main(String[] args).


3.There is a spelling mistake. It says Systm.out.println. It should be System.out.println.


4. Missing semicolon after println. 


5. Missing closing curly brace } for the class.
